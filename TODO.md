# TODO
These are in no particular order:
- More options, like opening result directly in web browser.
- Example programs.
- Infinite tape size.
- Make code prettier and fix naming conventions. Better, more descriptive comments.
- Optimisations.
- FreeBSD, MacOS support (Maybe Windows).
- Release binaries.
- Improved argument handling.
